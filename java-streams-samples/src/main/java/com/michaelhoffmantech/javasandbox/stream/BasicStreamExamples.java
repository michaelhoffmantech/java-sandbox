/**
 * Java streams are an approach in Functional Programming for processing a collection of items.
 * This processing is performed against a source of data that does not get modified. The data is then processed
 * through a pipeline with one or more processors mutating the data until it reaches the final outcome.
 *
 * This class provides simple examples, most of them from the book Modern Java Recipes by Kousen.
